## Phase Two Assessment - Day 2

This assessment is a way to gain insight into your current abilities in the concepts taught during Phase Two. This assessment will provide you insight into your strengths and areas where you might need improvement. *Success* on this assessment means that you *gain self awareness* and *expose your ignorance* to instructors who want to help you get better. These are uncomfortable, but essential to learning.

### Breathe
You've already finished 2 parts of the assessment yesterday. Great job! Remember to leave yesterday in its place.
Breathe. Focus on today. Today you will finish the third part. It may take you the full time to complete the challenge.
  
Do not build more complexity than is explicitly required.
